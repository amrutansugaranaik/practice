Few coding problems from the book Let Us C in Rust language. Most rust books online don't have any practice problems. So I am using the problem section of this book for practicing rust.

** Non working codes **

1_H_k.rs -> Didn't understand the question
1_H_m.rs -> not working for all input. With String, it is easy.
