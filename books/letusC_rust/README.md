Few coding problems from the book Let Us C in Rust language. Most rust books online don't have any practice problems. So I am using the problem section of this book for practicing rust.

** Non working codes **

1_H_k.rs -> Didn't understand the question
1_H_m.rs -> not working for all input. With String, it is easy.
2_C_d.rs -> calendar program. I don't know how to solve.
2_C_j.rs, 2_C_k.rs, 2_C_l.rs -> Need to do. Got bored.
2_G_c.rs, 2_G_g.rs, 2_G_h.rs -> long simple conditions, will do later
Section K of chapter 2 has questions already solved in section C and G.
3_B_a.rs -> will do later
3_E_d.rs -> need to think an approach other than bit masking
3_E_h.rs -> will do after studying array.
j,k,l -> will do later
